# Gamedev STEM Expo Demo

This is the demo that will be used in the STEM Expo for 2023!
The game is made in Lua and LOVE2D as the game framework.
https://love2d.org/ <-- I used version 11.4 to make this game

The map is designed using Tiled, a level editor that can be found here! https://www.mapeditor.org/
